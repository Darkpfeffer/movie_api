# Welcome to Movie_API

This REST API is used to communicate with myFlix Frontend (React and Angular), and the MongoDB Database. 

In the database, the movies are stored, and the data about them will be transferred to the Frontend upon the corresponding request.

Users are able to register, log in, check the details of the movies, save movies to their favorite list, edit user info, and delete their account.
